3.3 Description
The first page of the site, index.html, walks through the intricacies of the encryption algorithm.  Included in the description are images to increase the reader's understanding of the encryption.  Also included are examples for more abstract concepts.
3.2 Interactive Demonstration
The DES algorithm is implemented entirely in JavaScript in DES.js, located in the JavaScript folder.  The DES algorithm is coded in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.  In which each sixty four bit block of the message is encoded/decoded separately.
The interactive example takes key and message or ciphertext as input.  Message and key are string values.  Cipher text is sixty  four bit format.  As output the initial permutation of the key and message/ciphertext, round key, round message/ciphertext, output of each block and the final output.
